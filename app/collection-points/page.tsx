            In Nigeria, pharmaceutical waste disposal regulations and EPA
            requirements for the management of pharmaceutical waste vary in each
            state. As a healthcare provider, it is important to understand the
            regulations that govern your state to ensure that your waste
            handling and treatment processes are compliant. To assist with
            navigating the medical waste and sharp disposal requirements that
            exist for your state, we&apos;ve built an extensive library of blogs
            that review guidelines in your area and what regulatory bodies to
            research.
